# Introduction:

Accurate wheel speed measurement is essential for Baja SAE vehicle data logging and performance tuning. To achieve a reliable RPM sensing system under harsh off-road conditions, the team selected Hall-effect sensors for their durability, dust resistance, and contactless operation. These sensors detect magnetic field changes from nearby ferrous targets or magnets, producing digital pulses proportional to wheel rotation. Models such as the Honeywell 1GT101DC and ZF Cherry GS100502 are commonly used in Baja applications for their automotive-grade sealing, compact size, and simple microcontroller interface.
