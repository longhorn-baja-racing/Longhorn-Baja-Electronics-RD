# Introduction:

The goal for this project was to eliminate any confusion drivers may have when driving during the endurance race. Many teams currently measure their fuel level by estimating their average fuel consumption rate, and stopping their driver after a certain amount of time passes. This system is inaccurate and inefficient. This project aims to give that data to the driver in an easy to understand way. The specific end goal for this project is to provide the driver with a fuel low indicator light that informs him when he needs to return to the pit for a refueling.
