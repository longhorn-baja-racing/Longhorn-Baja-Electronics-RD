# Introduction:

Baja SAE is a collegiate engineering competition where student teams design, build, and race off-road vehicles capable of withstanding rough terrain and harsh operating conditions. Each vehicle is powered by a small internal combustion engine, and performance depends heavily on reliability, endurance, and thermal management. In these events, engine overheating poses a significant challenge, as sustained high loads and limited airflow can quickly elevate component temperatures beyond safe operating limits. This project specifically addresses the challenge of monitoring and preventing engine overheating through a sensor-based temperature detection and warning system.
