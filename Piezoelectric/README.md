# Introduction

The goal for this project is to develop a method to implement a driver feedback system to help the driver improve their driving techniques in response to the state of the car. To achieve this, piezoelectric sensors can be placed in various locations on the car to collect data. The piezoelectric sensors measure vibration, and the connected ESP32 microcontroller will interpret the data to give real-time feedback to the driver to improve their driving.
