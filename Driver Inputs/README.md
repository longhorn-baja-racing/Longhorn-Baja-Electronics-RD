# Introduction:

The goal of this project was to design a pedal input telemetry system for the Baja SAE vehicle that records throttle and brake activity in real time. This system helps drivers and engineers analyze pedal data to improve driving technique, throttle response, and braking performance. It uses potentiometers to measure pedal movement and pressure, which are read by an ESP32 microcontroller. The signals are filtered, converted to digital data, and sent through a CAN bus for visualization. The data can then be compared to lap times and other metrics to optimize performance. Overall, the system provides accurate, fast feedback and creates a foundation for future vehicle data collection and tuning.
